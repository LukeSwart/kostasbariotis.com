And the one that got me go "whhaaaaat??" is the one that advices you to put all of your business logic inside a WebWorker. Whaaaaat?</p>\n<p>A WebWorker is a separate thread that runs Javascript but has no access to the DOM or the <code>window</code> object. But it can do complex queries and loops, accessing core <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers">functions and APIs</a>, while you are letting the main thread, the UI thread, to handle the UI stuff only.</p>\n<p>Rendering the DOM is so expensive, specially when it comes to complex interfaces we have nowadays. Not so long ago, the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html">VirtualDOM</a> introduced which tried to speed up the rendering process by rendering only what actually changed, instead of re-rendering the whole page. But, that\'s not enough apparently, since even such few changes can\'t be handle well by low powered devices such as mobiles phones and watches.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the 60fpm barrier, we are completely freeing the main thread to be able to handle the rendering only and we start WebWorkers to handle our business logic.</p>\n<p>I found <a href="http://www.pocketjavascript.com/blog/2015/11/23/introducing-pokedex-org">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@nsisodiya/flux-inside-web-workers-cc51fb463882#.iv69h6ih2">great</a> examples of this concept. Both, they are suggesting keeping the whole app outside the main thread and send there only the patch of the changed DOM to be rendered. The UI thread can then handle only rendering and complex fancy animations.</p>\n<p>Oh, by the way, Nodejs fans, <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2133">Workers are coming</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"January 01, 1970",path:"/ui-thread-free",tags:null,title:"UI thread free"}}},pathContext:{prev:{excerpt:"I am Software Engineer being paid two times over the standard Greek wage.

But why you say.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up I had to deal with two things: a) I didn't had the money to do anything I wanted to do and b) I had to do shitty jobs to get that money.</p>\n<p>So I had to find a solution. I was introduced to programming and everyone were talking about how is the job of the future. I fall in love with it since my first key strokes. I made my decision at that moment.</p>\n<p>I had a mentor back then. My cousin. 20 years of experience more than me and he really wanted to stack them all in my head. Once he said to me: \"There are two options in life. You can either be a cow, walking around the same grass land your whole life or you can be a hawk, flying and traveling every day and watching the world from the sky. You got choose.\" That completely messed up my childhood. I had to find a way to be hawk.</p>\n<p>I don't like long term goals. Even for my longest goals I will break them into smaller tasks and commit to those.</p>\n<p>My most long term goal was and still is one. Is the one that I set when I was a kid in order to solve my problems.</p>\n<p>To be a high paid professional in my industry until my thirtieth birthday.</p>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<p>Professional: I love programming and that is the primary reason I do it for living. If I didn't do it for any reason, I would probably doing it in my free time. I wrote my first lines of code in the age of 10. That was it for me. Right there I discovered what I wanted to do in life.</p>\n<p>High paid: Not just paying the bills. I want to be high paid. Have you ever declined a suggestion for a road trip or even to get out for some drinks, cause you couldn't afford it? Yeah, I know. I don't want this. I want money to not be problem. They're supposed to be the ticket, not the barrier.</p>\n<p>The original goal was until the age of 25. I failed, so I rescheduled it. If I were to predict my next deadline, I would say I won't fail this time. Even if I do, I will just set the next goal and move on. I had enough.</p>",id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/the-reason-i-do-what-i-do/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/the-reason-i-do-what-i-do",tags:null,title:"The reason I do what I do"}},next:{excerpt:"https://divan.github.io/posts/go concurrency visualize/",html:'<p><a href="https://divan.github.io/posts/go_concurrency_visualize/">https://divan.github.io/posts/go<em>concurrency</em>visualize/</a></p>',id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/untitled/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/untitled",tags:null,title:"(Untitled)"}}}}}});
