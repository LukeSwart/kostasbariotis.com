But why you say.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up I had to deal with two things: a) I didn't had the money to do anything I wanted to do and b) I had to do shitty jobs to get that money.</p>\n<p>So I had to find a solution. I was introduced to programming and everyone were talking about how is the job of the future. I fall in love with it since my first key strokes. I made my decision at that moment.</p>\n<p>I had a mentor back then. My cousin. 20 years of experience more than me and he really wanted to stack them all in my head. Once he said to me: \"There are two options in life. You can either be a cow, walking around the same grass land your whole life or you can be a hawk, flying and traveling every day and watching the world from the sky. You got choose.\" That completely messed up my childhood. I had to find a way to be hawk.</p>\n<p>I don't like long term goals. Even for my longest goals I will break them into smaller tasks and commit to those.</p>\n<p>My most long term goal was and still is one. Is the one that I set when I was a kid in order to solve my problems.</p>\n<p>To be a high paid professional in my industry until my thirtieth birthday.</p>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<p>Professional: I love programming and that is the primary reason I do it for living. If I didn't do it for any reason, I would probably doing it in my free time. I wrote my first lines of code in the age of 10. That was it for me. Right there I discovered what I wanted to do in life.</p>\n<p>High paid: Not just paying the bills. I want to be high paid. Have you ever declined a suggestion for a road trip or even to get out for some drinks, cause you couldn't afford it? Yeah, I know. I don't want this. I want money to not be problem. They're supposed to be the ticket, not the barrier.</p>\n<p>The original goal was until the age of 25. I failed, so I rescheduled it. If I were to predict my next deadline, I would say I won't fail this time. Even if I do, I will just set the next goal and move on. I had enough.</p>",id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/the-reason-i-do-what-i-do/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/the-reason-i-do-what-i-do",tags:null,title:"The reason I do what I do"}},{excerpt:"https://arukas.io/en/ \n https://zeit.co/now \n http://www.evennode.com/ \n http://surge.sh/ \n https://www.nodechef.com",html:'<p><a href="https://arukas.io/en/">https://arukas.io/en/</a>\n<a href="https://zeit.co/now">https://zeit.co/now</a>\n<a href="http://www.evennode.com/">http://www.evennode.com/</a>\n<a href="http://surge.sh/">http://surge.sh/</a>\n<a href="https://www.nodechef.com">https://www.nodechef.com</a></p>',id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/untitled-3/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/untitled-3",tags:null,title:"Nodejs hosting"}}],page:16,pagesSum:17}}}});
