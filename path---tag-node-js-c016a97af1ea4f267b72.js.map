He had a list of projects that he actively uses but he didn't want to always be checking their issues list for new issues that he could get his hands on. So we thought it would be cool if we had a way to watch a GitHub repository for issues of specific tags, e.g. \\\"Need help\\\", \\\"Good first contribution\\\", etc.</p>\\n<p>I thought that's something I could easily hack in a weekend. So here's <a href=\\\"https://gityeller.com\\\">GitYeller</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Stack</h2>\\n<p>GitYeller is built using JavaScript. Node.js and React more specifically.

The worker is continuously traversing the collection and checking them against GitHub to see if there is anything new. It's that simple!</p>\\n<h2>Worker</h2>\\n<p>At first, I thought a queue would be a good fit for this since I needed to keep the order that the documents were being created. I knew that the purpose of a queue was to keep the messages processing in order but only to be processed once. I wanted to keep processing the same messages over and over again. So I decided to go with the simplest way possible.

href=\\\"https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.0/api/Cursor.html\\\">MongoDB cursor object</a> and a function that you want to be called with every item, it keeps traversing the collection and gets updated even when a new item is being created. There is no need to restart the connection to MongoDB.</p>\\n<p>The <code>setTimeout</code> ensures that the next call will get it's own call stack so we don't overflow the current one.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/index.js\\\">Here's the complete</a> worker's source code.</p>\\n<h2>Check against GitHub</h2>\\n<p>Let's see how we are asking GitHub if it has something new to show us. The actual API call is this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will return us a list of issues labeled with that specific label of that repository.</p>\\n<p>Once we make this request for the first time, we have a timestamp of the latest check. Next time, we will just query with that timestamp, in order to get only the issues that have been created between the last check and now (Actually GitHub returns those issues that have even been updated during that period, so <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/worker.js#L89\\\">I have to make some extra checks</a>). Now the query looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>GitHub's API has a limit. They allow you to do certain API calls in a certain amount of time. I wanted to minimize the calls as much possible because once I hit that limit I won't be able to take the results I wanted so the users will never get notified.</p>\\n<p>Each time we are making this request, GitHub will count minus one requests of our available quota. In order to save some juice I am using <a href=\\\"https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests\\\">GitHub's conditional requests</a>. The above request will return us an ETag header with a value. We can use that value to validate whether our latest response is outdated or not. If it's not, GitHub will respond with a 304 Not Modified status code and an empty body.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE\\nHEADERS: If-None-Match: LATEST_RESPONSE_ETAG</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This way the request won't be counted. We saved a request and we will only be charged if there is actually something new.</p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://bitworking.org/news/150/REST-Tip-Deep-etags-give-you-more-benefits\\\">ETags and \\\"conditional requests\\\"</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Certainly, the solution is not optimal. Once the collection grows bigger, the time between the checks for each individual item in the collection will also be long. But it was a fun weekend project. I am already watching the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nodejs/node\\\">node.js</a> repo for new issues labeled <code>v7.x</code>.</p>\\n<p>Which repo are you going to watch?

Databases change very often and contain data that can even disintegrate our whole application if they get out of sync. Changing a live database, whether it's related to schema or data, can be hard. Modern apps, where Agile methodologies along with processes such as <a href=\\\"http://continuousdelivery.com/\\\">Continuous Integration</a> apply, have raised the bar of complexity so maintaining a database separately from the application's business logic can be quite painful.</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, we have <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\\\">Database Migrations</a>, a technique to help us keep our database changes under control.</p>\\n<h2>The problem</h2>\\n<p>Problems I have seen over the years:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Apps often need certain data to be in place in order to run. In a fresh environment, a team member may not have those or may need to import a subset of the production database.</li>\\n<li>Different instances of databases, such as production, stage, local environments, may get out of sync.</li>\\n<li>Multiple environments setups raise the complexity of different databases versions running at the same time</li>\\n<li>Continuous delivery needs repeatable and testable tasks</li>\\n<li>When a developer puts his/her hands in the DB, that change will be lost forever. Code evolves along with our Schema so keeping changes tracked is quite a necessity</li>\\n<li>Data integrity after updates</li>\\n<li>Rollbacks are our safety net of broken deployments. You can’t rollback your app when your data will be out of order.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Shorter release cycles often require database changes. Having those changes under version control allows us to make changes safely and in a more consistent way. A crucial part of following such methodologies is the evolutionary design which can help us keep track of how the database evolved along with our application. That way our data can rollback at any point of the history hand in hand with our app.</p>\\n<p>Evolving our database design along with our core functioning data during the application development, and doing that in a seamless way, requires the use of more sophisticated processes like Database migrations, which essentially are the management of incremental, reversible changes to our databases.</p>\\n<p>Database migrations are all about treating our database as another piece of code while applying core principles of Continuous Integration. Publishing new features along with the database changes, without requiring manual Ops work and removing any hands-on session from the DB is the way to move forward and create robust apps.</p>\\n<p>This article will walk you through the different types of migrations, how they are being used and how to write DB migrations in a Nodejs environment.</p>\\n<p>Let's explore the types of database migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Types of Migrations</h2>\\n<p>Database migrations usually have two forms. Both of those forms are usually required in a long-running project.</p>\\n<h3>Altering schema</h3>\\n<p>One of them is when we are in need of changing the database's schema. For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\\n<h3>Migrating data</h3>\\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code>Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code>First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code>Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code>Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code>Name</code> field into <code>First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\\n<h2>Automation is the key</h2>\\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code. This will allow us to store them into our VCS and run them on demand and in an autonomous way.</p>\\n<h2>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>\\n<p>As we know, SQL and NoSQL have some core differences but that also doesn't mean that we can omit migrations in any of them. SQL structure is strictly defined and both data and schema changes can be safely done using migrations. NoSQL, on the other hand, may not need that much of a schema change, due to their elasticity in that subject, but will definitely need data migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Database?</h2>\\n<p>Modern apps don't necessarily handle data or talk to a database directly. E.g., in a Microservices environment, applications may rely on other applications to hold their data and communicate with them through a REST API. That's ok because migrations may still need to run. But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\\n<h2>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\\\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations. It's not opinionated at all and it doesn't provide any helper functions to make your actual migrations. It's just a library that will store what migrations have run. Which is actually what I need. If you need a more powerful thing you may want to take a look at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate\\\">db-migrate</a>, which provides adapters for major databases and it will help you make changes to those in a more intuitive way.</p>\\n<p>Migration systems are providing a few standard things in order to make your migrations. Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\\n<h3>Write a migration</h3>\\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script. The function to run when we are migrating and the function when we are rolling back:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'use strict'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'bluebird'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  up<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* Here we write our migration function */</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* This runs if we decide to rollback.

For that matter, we should choose our naming strategy wisely before implementation. I have chosen to give them a separate versioning, e.g. 1.0.js, 1.1.js or we could give them the issue ID of our PM that refers to the particular requirement. The choice is yours. Just be consistent.</p>\\n<h3>Keep track of the migrations that have already been executed</h3>\\n<p>At any given moment, we must be able to tell what migrations have been executed and which migration needs to run next if there is one to run.\\nThis allows us to know the state of our database.</p>\\n<p>Umzug can use Sequelize to store the history of the migration into MySQL. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug#custom\\\">But with no hassle at all, we can write our own Adaptor to store them wherever we want</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Run a migration or run all migrations</h3>\\n<p>We have to be able to run a specific migration or run all migrations we have written. Those must run in order because usually some of them depend on others.\\nE.g. on a fresh environment we must run all migrations in order to bring the newly created database to its current state, as it currently lies in production.</p>\\n<p>To run all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to run up to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Rollback a migration</h3>\\n<p>When defining one particular migration we are describing changes that will be applied to the database. Those changes must be reversible and that is why we must also describe the reverse action of that migration.\\nIn case we need to rollback our application back in a previous state that also introduced database changes, those changes must be revert as well in order for the application to continue operating like it used to do.</p>\\n<p>Just like <code>up</code>, but running <code>down</code> instead:\\nTo revert all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to revert down to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Automating</h3>\\n<p>umzug doesn't come with a CLI out of the box, but it doesn't take much to write one yourself.\\nAfter I wrote mine, it's just a matter of:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to run all migrations in fresh environments.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>up<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">|</span>down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to go to that particular migration.

There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

At first, we call our function without a parameter so the first condition will be true and an error will be thrown. Then we stub the <code>request</code> object so it will run the callback function with an error. This will trigger the second condition and reject our promise. Inside the <code>catch</code> function, we know that the promise has been rejected. For the end, we stub the callback to return with a null error and a body that will resolve the promise and we test that inside the <code>then</code> function. 100% code coverage.</p>\\n<p>This way we have completely isolated our Unit Under Test and made it blazingly fast to run since we don't make any actual HTTP requests.

I explained the concept of TDD and described my tools of choice for integrating the TDD flow with Node.js. It was great.</p>\\n<p>I didn't got into GUI testing and I saw a major interest on that. So I decided to take a look at the current state of GUI testing. Here are the main tools that I came up with:</p>\\n<h2>Zombie.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://zombie.js.org/\\\">Zombie</a> uses <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\\\">jsdom</a> to parse the required HTML and Javascript and then simulate the desired behaviour. I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages. For SPA apps, Zombie wouldn't be an ideal solution.</p>\\n<h2>Casper.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://casperjs.org/\\\">Casper</a> on the other hand, is a wrapper around <a href=\\\"http://phantomjs.org/\\\">Phantom.js</a> which utilises a <a href=\\\"https://webkit.org/\\\">Webkit</a> headless browser and will do a full rendering of your web page in order to test it. Since you will have a full representation of your site you can even <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres\\\">take screenshots for easier QA</a>.</p>\\n<p>Casper.js has neat documentation and it's API is really easy to follow and adopt.</p>\\n<h2>Nightwatch.js</h2>\\n<p>Now, on the heavy side, we have <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\\\">Selenium</a>. Selenium is a set of projects. It started off by auto running browsers and injecting code into them so we can test it. Since then, browsers vendors kept evolving and expose a full set of control over their browsers so Selenium has native support over those, with the <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\\\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\\n<p>You will have to install all the browsers you need to test locally and then use Selenium to run tests on them. It's pretty basic.</p>\\n<p>Selenium's internals and configuration is a bit overcomplicated and if you don't need it, you don't have to get into it. <a href=\\\"http://nightwatchjs.org/\\\">Nightwatch</a> is a great layer of abstraction on top of Selenium that will do all the heavy work for you.</p>\\n<h1>At the end</h1>\\n<p>I am sure there are tone of other solutions out there.

In this article I would like to talk about the mindset of adopting such an infrastructure and some key concepts you must keep in mind, especially when using <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\\\">AWS's SQS</a>, a cloud hosted Messaging System.</p>\\n<p>Besides SQS, there is also, <a href=\\\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/\\\">Azure's Storage</a> and I am sure there are others as well. There are also <a href=\\\"http://queues.io/\\\">open source implementations</a> that you can host on your machines.</p>\\n<h2>What's a QCW</h2>\\n<p>A QCW is purely described by the separation of the Web Tier that generates requests and the Service Tier that processes them and it's a subset of the <a href=\\\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html\\\">CQRS pattern</a>. Thus, loose coupling of the dependent services can be achieved.</p>\\n<p>The essential part here is that we are going from a <em>direct response of the Server</em> model to a <em>I will process that later, continue with what you're doing</em> model, moving towards a Tasks Based workflow. It's a great candidate for time consuming processes or when the possibility of a system to be down is high and won't be able to service requests immediately. The <em>at-least-once delivery</em> of requests can be guaranteed.</p>\\n<p>By Queue we are referring to a service that implements the standard data structure Queue and sits between a Producer and a Consumer. The Producers generates requests and puts them in the Queue via an <a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/MakingRequestsArticle.html\\\">API</a>. The Consumer then reads the Queue and processes them. The communication is asynchronous which mean that the Producers won't get an immediate response from the requests that sends.  Instead the Consumer may then choose to somehow inform the Producer about the results. Either by sending an email to the admin or by sending a message through a WebSocket that can then be displayed directly to the user.</p>\\n<h2>Why to use it</h2>\\n<p>While there are a lot of problems such a workflow can solve, the most common one is that the processing part of our application can't handle eager clients that are sending requests too fast or send requests that will take too long to process.</p>\\n<p>The Producers can send requests to the Consumer, through the Queue, as aggressively as he wants, but the Consumer will process them based on the current workload.</p>\\n<p>By keeping Requests to a separate place we can also not worry about losing requests since the Consumer can go off and back online again and start processing requests from the point where he left them.</p>\\n<p>There are many more gains but we found those to be the most essential problems we need to solve.</p>\\n<h2>Consuming the Queue</h2>\\n<p>A complex thing about consuming a Queue is that of the Consumer and the policy he follows for reading and processing messages. In general, the flow goes like this:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Get the next available message from the top of the Queue</li>\\n<li>Process the message</li>\\n<li>Delete the message</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It's essential to note that you need the message that is in the the top of the queue. Otherwise, you can't guarantee that all messages will be processed in the same time period. You need the <strong><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO\\\">FIFO</a></strong> policy. Unfortunately, AWS SQS can't guarantee that for you, because of their distributed nature and you have to implement such functionality by your self.</p>\\n<h3>Long Polling</h3>\\n<p>In order to get new messages, you have to ask the Queue once in a while if it has any messages. That's <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/12855533/1955940\\\">Polling</a>. Several implementation provides some sort of Pushing mechanism that will directly notify a Consumer that there are pending messages to be processed. SQS doesn't support that, but they support <strong><a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html\\\">Long Polling</a></strong> which is actually when we ask the Queue for new messages and if there are none, the connection is being kept alive until there is one or till the connection times out. SQS supports up to 20 seconds of Long Polling. After that, we must re ask the Queue and wait another 20 seconds.</p>\\n<h3>Visibility Timeout</h3>\\n<p>While processing a message, a lot of things can go wrong that will make the process to fail. In such case, the message can't be deleted and must remain in the Queue in order to reprocess it. But if we leave it there, it's going to be returned over and over again and we can't be sure that is going to succeed the next time. Instead of deleting the message, the Queue can hide it for a specific period of time, so we can continue processing other messages and reprocess that message at some point in the future again. This is a <strong><a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html\\\">Queue's Visibility Timeout</a></strong>.</p>\\n<h3>Poisoned Messages</h3>\\n<p>Still, this won't guarantee that the message will be processed successfully at any time. The message may be poisoned, that means that it failed passing our domain's model requirements and that it won't be processed unless we change our logic. Those are called <strong>Poison Messages</strong> and a policy must be specified that will take care of those. For example, a counter may be kept for each poisoned message and after the third time that it failed to be processed it must be deleted.</p>\\n<h3>Dead Letter Queues</h3>\\n<p>In case of such a failure, you don't want to bypass that without investigating the cause. You'll need to know what was the reason that marked the message as poisoned. Hopefully, instead of deleting it after the third attempt, you can store it in a <strong><a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/SQSDeadLetterQueue.html\\\">Dead Letter Queue</a></strong>. A Dead Letter Queue is simply another Queue that holds only the failed messages. Those can be messages that couldn't be processed or messages that couldn't be pushed in the Queue cause it's full or non responding. After you store them there, you can go back at any time and examine those messages and see what you have done wrong in the first place.</p>\\n<h2>Finally</h2>\\n<p>So we talked about what a QCW is, how it can be used and also for some key concepts of SQS such as Queue's Visibility Timeout, Polling, Poison Messages and Dead Letter Queues. AWS has a great <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sqs/\\\">documentation on SQS</a>.</p>\\n<p>Also, <a href=\\\"http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm\\\">Ben Addel</a> has a nice implementation of a <a href=\\\"http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2792-shedding-the-monolithic-application-with-aws-simple-queue-service-sqs-and-node-js.htm\\\">Nodejs SQS Consumer</a> that uses Promises to do Long Polling. It is basic, without handling Poison Messages or using Dead Letter Queues and it's a great starting point.</p>\\n<p>I've also found the Queue Centric Workflow chapter of the <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Architecture-Patterns-Using-Microsoft/dp/1449319777\\\">Cloud Architecture Patterns</a> books to have some excellent resources.</p>\\n<p>If you have any previous experience in any of the subjects talked above, please share it in the comments.

The worker is continuously traversing the collection and checking them against GitHub to see if there is anything new. It's that simple!</p>\\n<h2>Worker</h2>\\n<p>At first, I thought a queue would be a good fit for this since I needed to keep the order that the documents were being created. I knew that the purpose of a queue was to keep the messages processing in order but only to be processed once. I wanted to keep processing the same messages over and over again. So I decided to go with the simplest way possible.

and gets updated even when a new item is being created. There is no need to restart the connection to MongoDB.</p>\\n<p>The <code>setTimeout</code> ensures that the next call will get it's own call stack so we don't overflow the current one.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/index.js\\\">Here's the complete</a> worker's source code.</p>\\n<h2>Check against GitHub</h2>\\n<p>Let's see how we are asking GitHub if it has something new to show us. The actual API call is this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will return us a list of issues labeled with that specific label of that repository.</p>\\n<p>Once we make this request for the first time, we have a timestamp of the latest check. Next time, we will just query with that timestamp, in order to get only the issues that have been created between the last check and now (Actually GitHub returns those issues that have even been updated during that period, so <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/worker.js#L89\\\">I have to make some extra checks</a>). Now the query looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>GitHub's API has a limit. They allow you to do certain API calls in a certain amount of time. I wanted to minimize the calls as much possible because once I hit that limit I won't be able to take the results I wanted so the users will never get notified.</p>\\n<p>Each time we are making this request, GitHub will count minus one requests of our available quota. In order to save some juice I am using <a href=\\\"https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests\\\">GitHub's conditional requests</a>. The above request will return us an ETag header with a value. We can use that value to validate whether our latest response is outdated or not. If it's not, GitHub will respond with a 304 Not Modified status code and an empty body.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE\\nHEADERS: If-None-Match: LATEST_RESPONSE_ETAG</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This way the request won't be counted. We saved a request and we will only be charged if there is actually something new.</p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://bitworking.org/news/150/REST-Tip-Deep-etags-give-you-more-benefits\\\">ETags and \\\"conditional requests\\\"</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Certainly, the solution is not optimal. Once the collection grows bigger, the time between the checks for each individual item in the collection will also be long. But it was a fun weekend project. I am already watching the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nodejs/node\\\">node.js</a> repo for new issues labeled <code>v7.x</code>.</p>\\n<p>Which repo are you going to watch?

Databases change very often and contain data that can even disintegrate our whole application if they get out of sync. Changing a live database, whether it's related to schema or data, can be hard. Modern apps, where Agile methodologies along with processes such as <a href=\\\"http://continuousdelivery.com/\\\">Continuous Integration</a> apply, have raised the bar of complexity so maintaining a database separately from the application's business logic can be quite painful.</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, we have <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\\\">Database Migrations</a>, a technique to help us keep our database changes under control.</p>\\n<h2>The problem</h2>\\n<p>Problems I have seen over the years:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Apps often need certain data to be in place in order to run. In a fresh environment, a team member may not have those or may need to import a subset of the production database.</li>\\n<li>Different instances of databases, such as production, stage, local environments, may get out of sync.</li>\\n<li>Multiple environments setups raise the complexity of different databases versions running at the same time</li>\\n<li>Continuous delivery needs repeatable and testable tasks</li>\\n<li>When a developer puts his/her hands in the DB, that change will be lost forever. Code evolves along with our Schema so keeping changes tracked is quite a necessity</li>\\n<li>Data integrity after updates</li>\\n<li>Rollbacks are our safety net of broken deployments. You can’t rollback your app when your data will be out of order.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Shorter release cycles often require database changes. Having those changes under version control allows us to make changes safely and in a more consistent way. A crucial part of following such methodologies is the evolutionary design which can help us keep track of how the database evolved along with our application. That way our data can rollback at any point of the history hand in hand with our app.</p>\\n<p>Evolving our database design along with our core functioning data during the application development, and doing that in a seamless way, requires the use of more sophisticated processes like Database migrations, which essentially are the management of incremental, reversible changes to our databases.</p>\\n<p>Database migrations are all about treating our database as another piece of code while applying core principles of Continuous Integration. Publishing new features along with the database changes, without requiring manual Ops work and removing any hands-on session from the DB is the way to move forward and create robust apps.</p>\\n<p>This article will walk you through the different types of migrations, how they are being used and how to write DB migrations in a Nodejs environment.</p>\\n<p>Let's explore the types of database migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Types of Migrations</h2>\\n<p>Database migrations usually have two forms. Both of those forms are usually required in a long-running project.</p>\\n<h3>Altering schema</h3>\\n<p>One of them is when we are in need of changing the database's schema. For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\\n<h3>Migrating data</h3>\\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code>Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code>First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code>Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code>Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code>Name</code> field into <code>First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\\n<h2>Automation is the key</h2>\\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code. This will allow us to store them into our VCS and run them on demand and in an autonomous way.</p>\\n<h2>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>\\n<p>As we know, SQL and NoSQL have some core differences but that also doesn't mean that we can omit migrations in any of them. SQL structure is strictly defined and both data and schema changes can be safely done using migrations. NoSQL, on the other hand, may not need that much of a schema change, due to their elasticity in that subject, but will definitely need data migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Database?</h2>\\n<p>Modern apps don't necessarily handle data or talk to a database directly. E.g., in a Microservices environment, applications may rely on other applications to hold their data and communicate with them through a REST API. That's ok because migrations may still need to run. But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\\n<h2>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\\\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations. It's not opinionated at all and it doesn't provide any helper functions to make your actual migrations. It's just a library that will store what migrations have run. Which is actually what I need. If you need a more powerful thing you may want to take a look at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate\\\">db-migrate</a>, which provides adapters for major databases and it will help you make changes to those in a more intuitive way.</p>\\n<p>Migration systems are providing a few standard things in order to make your migrations. Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\\n<h3>Write a migration</h3>\\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script. The function to run when we are migrating and the function when we are rolling back:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'use strict'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'bluebird'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  up<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* Here we write our migration function */</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* This runs if we decide to rollback.

For that matter, we should choose our naming strategy wisely before implementation. I have chosen to give them a separate versioning, e.g. 1.0.js, 1.1.js or we could give them the issue ID of our PM that refers to the particular requirement. The choice is yours. Just be consistent.</p>\\n<h3>Keep track of the migrations that have already been executed</h3>\\n<p>At any given moment, we must be able to tell what migrations have been executed and which migration needs to run next if there is one to run.\\nThis allows us to know the state of our database.</p>\\n<p>Umzug can use Sequelize to store the history of the migration into MySQL. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug#custom\\\">But with no hassle at all, we can write our own Adaptor to store them wherever we want</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Run a migration or run all migrations</h3>\\n<p>We have to be able to run a specific migration or run all migrations we have written. Those must run in order because usually some of them depend on others.\\nE.g. on a fresh environment we must run all migrations in order to bring the newly created database to its current state, as it currently lies in production.</p>\\n<p>To run all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to run up to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Rollback a migration</h3>\\n<p>When defining one particular migration we are describing changes that will be applied to the database. Those changes must be reversible and that is why we must also describe the reverse action of that migration.\\nIn case we need to rollback our application back in a previous state that also introduced database changes, those changes must be revert as well in order for the application to continue operating like it used to do.</p>\\n<p>Just like <code>up</code>, but running <code>down</code> instead:\\nTo revert all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to revert down to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Automating</h3>\\n<p>umzug doesn't come with a CLI out of the box, but it doesn't take much to write one yourself.\\nAfter I wrote mine, it's just a matter of:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to run all migrations in fresh environments.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>up<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">|</span>down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to go to that particular migration. This will run on every instance of our application at boot time, so if there is a pending migration, it will run it.</p>\\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Database manipulation should be part of our development process. There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

For that matter, Unit Tests need to be isolated and for that you need stubs.</p>\\n<p>Here I will use a small function and the <a href=\\\"http://sinonjs.org\\\">Sinonjs</a> to try to test it. My function does some checks and finally an HTTP call to an external service while similar functions would hit a DB. But our intention is to test the actual function and we don't want to hit the external service.</p>\\n<p>In case that you think: \\\"No we should let it hit the external so we can test that too\\\". Well no, remember, we are writing unit tests. You're talking about integration tests, where we test how multiple components interact with each other.

At first, we call our function without a parameter so the first condition will be true and an error will be thrown. Then we stub the <code>request</code> object so it will run the callback function with an error. This will trigger the second condition and reject our promise. Inside the <code>catch</code> function, we know that the promise has been rejected. For the end, we stub the callback to return with a null error and a body that will resolve the promise and we test that inside the <code>then</code> function. 100% code coverage.</p>\\n<p>This way we have completely isolated our Unit Under Test and made it blazingly fast to run since we don't make any actual HTTP requests.

I explained the concept of TDD and described my tools of choice for integrating the TDD flow with Node.js. It was great.</p>\\n<p>I didn't got into GUI testing and I saw a major interest on that. So I decided to take a look at the current state of GUI testing. Here are the main tools that I came up with:</p>\\n<h2>Zombie.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://zombie.js.org/\\\">Zombie</a> uses <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\\\">jsdom</a> to parse the required HTML and Javascript and then simulate the desired behaviour. I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages. For SPA apps, Zombie wouldn't be an ideal solution.</p>\\n<h2>Casper.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://casperjs.org/\\\">Casper</a> on the other hand, is a wrapper around <a href=\\\"http://phantomjs.org/\\\">Phantom.js</a> which utilises a <a href=\\\"https://webkit.org/\\\">Webkit</a> headless browser and will do a full rendering of your web page in order to test it. Since you will have a full representation of your site you can even <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres\\\">take screenshots for easier QA</a>.</p>\\n<p>Casper.js has neat documentation and it's API is really easy to follow and adopt.</p>\\n<h2>Nightwatch.js</h2>\\n<p>Now, on the heavy side, we have <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\\\">Selenium</a>. Selenium is a set of projects. It started off by auto running browsers and injecting code into them so we can test it. Since then, browsers vendors kept evolving and expose a full set of control over their browsers so Selenium has native support over those, with the <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\\\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\\n<p>You will have to install all the browsers you need to test locally and then use Selenium to run tests on them. It's pretty basic.</p>\\n<p>Selenium's internals and configuration is a bit overcomplicated and if you don't need it, you don't have to get into it. <a href=\\\"http://nightwatchjs.org/\\\">Nightwatch</a> is a great layer of abstraction on top of Selenium that will do all the heavy work for you.</p>\\n<h1>At the end</h1>\\n<p>I am sure there are tone of other solutions out there. Although, you will have to do a research on your own before starting your GUI testing journey, at then end just pick one and start.</p>\\n<p>Are you using something already?

In this article I would like to talk about the mindset of adopting such an infrastructure and some key concepts you must keep in mind, especially when using <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\\\">AWS's SQS</a>, a cloud hosted Messaging System.</p>\\n<p>Besides SQS, there is also, <a href=\\\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/\\\">Azure's Storage</a> and I am sure there are others as well. There are also <a href=\\\"http://queues.io/\\\">open source implementations</a> that you can host on your machines.</p>\\n<h2>What's a QCW</h2>\\n<p>A QCW is purely described by the separation of the Web Tier that generates requests and the Service Tier that processes them and it's a subset of the <a href=\\\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html\\\">CQRS pattern</a>. Thus, loose coupling of the dependent services can be achieved.</p>\\n<p>The essential part here is that we are going from a <em>direct response of the Server</em> model to a <em>I will process that later, continue with what you're doing</em> model, moving towards a Tasks Based workflow. It's a great candidate for time consuming processes or when the possibility of a system to be down is high and won't be able to service requests immediately. The <em>at-least-once delivery</em> of requests can be guaranteed.</p>\\n<p>By Queue we are referring to a service that implements the standard data structure Queue and sits between a Producer and a Consumer. The Producers generates requests and puts them in the Queue via an <a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/MakingRequestsArticle.html\\\">API</a>. The Consumer then reads the Queue and processes them. The communication is asynchronous which mean that the Producers won't get an immediate response from the requests that sends.  Instead the Consumer may then choose to somehow inform the Producer about the results. Either by sending an email to the admin or by sending a message through a WebSocket that can then be displayed directly to the user.</p>\\n<h2>Why to use it</h2>\\n<p>While there are a lot of problems such a workflow can solve, the most common one is that the processing part of our application can't handle eager clients that are sending requests too fast or send requests that will take too long to process.</p>\\n<p>The Producers can send requests to the Consumer, through the Queue, as aggressively as he wants, but the Consumer will process them based on the current workload.</p>\\n<p>By keeping Requests to a separate place we can also not worry about losing requests since the Consumer can go off and back online again and start processing requests from the point where he left them.</p>\\n<p>There are many more gains but we found those to be the most essential problems we need to solve.</p>\\n<h2>Consuming the Queue</h2>\\n<p>A complex thing about consuming a Queue is that of the Consumer and the policy he follows for reading and processing messages. In general, the flow goes like this:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Get the next available message from the top of the Queue</li>\\n<li>Process the message</li>\\n<li>Delete the message</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It's essential to note that you need the message that is in the the top of the queue. Otherwise, you can't guarantee that all messages will be processed in the same time period. You need the <strong><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO\\\">FIFO</a></strong> policy. Unfortunately, AWS SQS can't guarantee that for you, because of their distributed nature and you have to implement such functionality by your self.</p>\\n<h3>Long Polling</h3>\\n<p>In order to get new messages, you have to ask the Queue once in a while if it has any messages. That's <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/12855533/1955940\\\">Polling</a>. Several implementation provides some sort of Pushing mechanism that will directly notify a Consumer that there are pending messages to be processed. SQS doesn't support that, but they support <strong><a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html\\\">Long Polling</a></strong> which is actually when we ask the Queue for new messages and if there are none, the connection is being kept alive until there is one or till the connection times out. SQS supports up to 20 seconds of Long Polling. After that, we must re ask the Queue and wait another 20 seconds.</p>\\n<h3>Visibility Timeout</h3>\\n<p>While processing a message, a lot of things can go wrong that will make the process to fail. In such case, the message can't be deleted and must remain in the Queue in order to reprocess it. But if we leave it there, it's going to be returned over and over again and we can't be sure that is going to succeed the next time. Instead of deleting the message, the Queue can hide it for a specific period of time, so we can continue processing other messages and reprocess that message at some point in the future again. This is a <strong><a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html\\\">Queue's Visibility Timeout</a></strong>.</p>\\n<h3>Poisoned Messages</h3>\\n<p>Still, this won't guarantee that the message will be processed successfully at any time. The message may be poisoned, that means that it failed passing our domain's model requirements and that it won't be processed unless we change our logic. Those are called <strong>Poison Messages</strong> and a policy must be specified that will take care of those. For example, a counter may be kept for each poisoned message and after the third time that it failed to be processed it must be deleted.</p>\\n<h3>Dead Letter Queues</h3>\\n<p>In case of such a failure, you don't want to bypass that without investigating the cause. You'll need to know what was the reason that marked the message as poisoned. Hopefully, instead of deleting it after the third attempt, you can store it in a <strong><a href=\\\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/SQSDeadLetterQueue.html\\\">Dead Letter Queue</a></strong>. A Dead Letter Queue is simply another Queue that holds only the failed messages. Those can be messages that couldn't be processed or messages that couldn't be pushed in the Queue cause it's full or non responding. After you store them there, you can go back at any time and examine those messages and see what you have done wrong in the first place.</p>\\n<h2>Finally</h2>\\n<p>So we talked about what a QCW is, how it can be used and also for some key concepts of SQS such as Queue's Visibility Timeout, Polling, Poison Messages and Dead Letter Queues. AWS has a great <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sqs/\\\">documentation on SQS</a>.</p>\\n<p>Also, <a href=\\\"http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm\\\">Ben Addel</a> has a nice implementation of a <a href=\\\"http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2792-shedding-the-monolithic-application-with-aws-simple-queue-service-sqs-and-node-js.htm\\\">Nodejs SQS Consumer</a> that uses Promises to do Long Polling. It is basic, without handling Poison Messages or using Dead Letter Queues and it's a great starting point.</p>\\n<p>I've also found the Queue Centric Workflow chapter of the <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Architecture-Patterns-Using-Microsoft/dp/1449319777\\\">Cloud Architecture Patterns</a> books to have some excellent resources.</p>\\n<p>If you have any previous experience in any of the subjects talked above, please share it in the comments.
